## Bio

My name is Prisha Narasimhan, and I'm an economics and data science student passionate about using data and statistical modeling to create meaningful community impact. I have experience supporting large-scale technology modernization, cross-functional coordination, and data-driven decision-making across consulting, government, and technology environments. Looking ahead, I hope to bring quantitative analysis to public policy and international relations, translating data-driven insights into strategies that create positive social impact.
